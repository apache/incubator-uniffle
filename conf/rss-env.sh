XMX_SIZE="8g" # Coordinator/Dashboard JVM XMX size
SHUFFLE_SERVER_XMX_SIZE="00g" # ShuffleServer JVM XMX size

# Variables for the all components
# RSS_HOME, RSS home directory (Default: parent directory of the script).
# If you want to set it to another place, please make sure the RSS_HOME
# specified externally is respected, by defining it as follows:
#
# RSS_HOME=${RSS_HOME:-{another_rss_home_path}}
#
# RSS_CONF_DIR, RSS configuration directory (Default: ${RSS_HOME}/conf)
# Similar with RSS_HOME, RSS_CONF_DIR should respect external env variable.
#
# RSS_CONF_DIR=${RSS_CONF_DIR:-{another_rss_conf_dir}}

# RSS_CONF_DIR, RSS configuration directory (Default: ${RSS_HOME}/conf)
# HADOOP_CONF_DIR, Hadoop configuration directory (Default: ${HADOOP_HOME}/etc/hadoop)
# RSS_PID_DIR, Where the pid file is stored (Default: ${RSS_HOME})
# RSS_LOG_DIR, Where log files are stored (Default: ${RSS_HOME}/logs)

# Variables for the dashboard
# DASHBOARD_BASE_JVM_ARGS, Base JVM options, which by default is calculated from
# `DASHBOARD_XMX_SIZE` or `XMX_SIZE and has sane defaults. Normally no need for customization.
# DASHBOARD_JAVA_OPTS, Extra JVM options for the dashboard, which will append after base arguments.
# This will override some default JVM options if they are both specified in default and this one.

# Variables for the coordinator
# COORDINATOR_BASE_JVM_ARGS, Base JVM options, which by default is calculated from
# `COORDINATOR_XMX_SIZE` or `XMX_SIZE and has sane defaults. Normally no need for customization.
# COORDINATOR_JAVA_OPTS, Extra JVM options for the coordinator, which will append after base arguments.

# Variables for the shuffle server
# RSS_IP, IP address Shuffle Server binds to on this node (Default: first non-loopback ipv4)
# MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY_SIZE Shuffle Server JVM off heap memory size (Default: not set)
# MALLOC_ARENA_MAX, Set the number of memory arenas for Shuffle Server (Default: 4)
# SHUFFLE_SERVER_JVM_ARGS, Base JVM options, which by default is calculated from
# `SHUFFLE_SERVER_XMX_SIZE` or `XMX_SIZE and has sane defaults. Normally no need for customization.
# SHUFFLE_SERVER_JAVA_OPTS, Extra JVM options for the shuffle server, which will append after base arguments.
# SHUFFLE_SERVER_STORAGE_AUDIT_LOG_PATH, Shuffle Server storage audit log path (Default: ${RSS_LOG_DIR}/shuffle_server_storage_audit.log)
# SHUFFLE_SERVER_RPC_AUDIT_LOG_PATH, Shuffle Server RPC audit log path (Default: ${RSS_LOG_DIR}/shuffle_server_rpc_audit.log)
