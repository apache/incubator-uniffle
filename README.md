# Apache Uniffle (Incubating)

Uniffle is a unified remote shuffle service for compute engines.
It provides the ability to aggregate and store shuffle data on remote servers,
thus improving the performance and reliability of large jobs.
Currently it supports [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) and [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org).

## Architecture
![Rss Architecture](docs/asset/rss_architecture.png)
Uniffle contains coordinator cluster, shuffle server cluster and remote storage(eg, HDFS) if necessary.

Coordinator will collect status of shuffle server and do the assignment for the job.

Shuffle server will receive the shuffle data, merge them and write to storage.

Depend on different situation, Uniffle supports Memory & Local, Memory & Remote Storage(eg, HDFS), Memory & Local & Remote Storage(recommendation for production environment).

## Shuffle Process with Uniffle

* Spark driver ask coordinator to get shuffle server for shuffle process
* Spark task write shuffle data to shuffle server with following step:
![Rss Shuffle_Write](docs/asset/rss_shuffle_write.png)
   1. Send KV data to buffer
   2. Flush buffer to queue when buffer is full or buffer manager is full
   3. Thread pool get data from queue
   4. Request memory from shuffle server first and send the shuffle data
   5. Shuffle server cache data in memory first and flush to queue when buffer manager is full
   6. Thread pool get data from queue
   7. Write data to storage with index file and data file
   8. After write data, task report all blockId to shuffle server, this step is used for data validation later
   9. Store taskAttemptId in MapStatus to support Spark speculation

* Depend on different storage type, spark task read shuffle data from shuffle server or remote storage or both of them.

## Shuffle file format
The shuffle data is stored with index file and data file. Data file has all blocks for specific partition and index file has metadata for every block.

![Rss Shuffle_Write](docs/asset/rss_data_format.png)

## Supported Spark Version
Current support Spark 2.3.x, Spark 2.4.x, Spark3.0.x, Spark 3.1.x, Spark 3.2.x

Note: To support dynamic allocation, the patch(which is included in client-spark/patch folder) should be applied to Spark

## Supported MapReduce Version
Current support Hadoop 2.8.5's MapReduce framework.

## Building Uniffle
> note: currently Uniffle requires JDK 1.8 to build, adding later JDK support is on our roadmap.

Uniffle is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
To build it, run:

    mvn -DskipTests clean package

Build against profile Spark2(2.4.6)

    mvn -DskipTests clean package -Pspark2

Build against profile Spark3(3.1.2)

    mvn -DskipTests clean package -Pspark3

Build against Spark 3.2.x, Except 3.2.0

    mvn -DskipTests clean package -Pspark3.2

Build against Spark 3.2.0

    mvn -DskipTests clean package -Pspark3.2.0

To package the Uniffle, run:

    ./build_distribution.sh

Package against Spark 3.2.x, Except 3.2.0, run:

    ./build_distribution.sh --spark3-profile 'spark3.2'

Package against Spark 3.2.0, run:

    ./build_distribution.sh --spark3-profile 'spark3.2.0'

rss-xxx.tgz will be generated for deployment

     rss.storage.type MEMORY_LOCALFILE_HDFS
     rss.coordinator.quorum <coordinatorIp1>:19999,<coordinatorIp2>:19999
     # local storage path for shuffle server
     rss.storage.basePath /data1/rssdata,/data2/rssdata....
     # it's better to config thread num according to local disk num
     rss.server.flush.thread.alive 5
     rss.server.flush.threadPool.size 10
     rss.server.buffer.capacity 40g
     rss.server.read.buffer.capacity 20g
     rss.server.heartbeat.timeout 60000

     # there will be no data written to DFS if set it as 100g even rss.storage.type=MEMORY_LOCALFILE_HDFS
     # please set proper value if DFS is used, eg, 64m, 128m.
     rss.server.flush.cold.storage.threshold.size 100g
   ```
4. start Shuffle Server
   ```
    bash RSS_HOME/bin/start-shuffle-server.sh
   ```

### Deploy Spark Client
1. Add client jar to Spark classpath, eg, SPARK_HOME/jars/

   The jar for Spark2 is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/spark2/rss-client-XXXXX-shaded.jar

   The jar for Spark3 is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/spark3/rss-client-XXXXX-shaded.jar

2. Update Spark conf to enable Uniffle, eg,

   ```
   spark.shuffle.manager org.apache.spark.shuffle.RssShuffleManager
   spark.rss.coordinator.quorum <coordinatorIp1>:19999,<coordinatorIp2>:19999
   # Note: For Spark2, spark.sql.adaptive.enabled should be false because Spark2 doesn't support AQE.
   ```

### Support Spark dynamic allocation

To support spark dynamic allocation with Uniffle, spark code should be updated.
There are 3 patches for spark (2.4.6/3.1.2/3.2.1) in spark-patches folder for reference.

After apply the patch and rebuild spark, add following configuration in spark conf to enable dynamic allocation:
  ```
  spark.shuffle.service.enabled false
  spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled true
  ```

### Deploy MapReduce Client

1. Add client jar to the classpath of each NodeManager, e.g., <HADOOP>/share/hadoop/mapreduce/

The jar for MapReduce is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/mr/rss-client-mr-XXXXX-shaded.jar

2. Update MapReduce conf to enable Uniffle, eg,

   ```
   -Dmapreduce.rss.coordinator.quorum=<coordinatorIp1>:19999,<coordinatorIp2>:19999
   -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.RssMRAppMaster
   -Dmapreduce.job.map.output.collector.class=org.apache.hadoop.mapred.RssMapOutputCollector
   -Dmapreduce.job.reduce.shuffle.consumer.plugin.class=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.task.reduce.RssShuffle
   ```
Note that the RssMRAppMaster will automatically disable slow start (i.e., `mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps=1`)
and job recovery (i.e., `yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.recovery.enable=false`)

### Deploy In Kubernetes

We have provided operator of uniffle used for deploying it in kubernetes environments.

For details, see the following document:

[operator docs](docs/operator)

## Configuration

The important configuration is listed as following.

|Role|Link|
|---|---|
|coordinator|[Uniffle Coordinator Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/coordinator_guide.md)|
|shuffle server|[Uniffle Shuffle Server Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/server_guide.md)|
|client|[Uniffle Shuffle Client Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/client_guide.md)|

## Security: Hadoop kerberos authentication
The primary goals of the Uniffle Kerberos security are:
1. to enable secure data access for coordinator/shuffle-servers, like dynamic conf/exclude-node files stored in secured dfs cluster
2. to write shuffle data to kerberos secured dfs cluster for shuffle-servers.

The following security configurations are introduced.

|Property Name|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable|false|Whether enable access secured hadoop cluster|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.krb5-conf.file|-|The file path of krb5.conf. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.keytab.file|-|The kerberos keytab file path. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.principal|-|The kerberos keytab principal. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.relogin.interval.sec|60|The kerberos authentication relogin interval. unit: sec|

* The proxy user mechanism is used to keep the data isolation in uniffle, which means the shuffle-data written by 
  shuffle-servers is owned by spark app's user. To achieve the this, the login user specified by above config should 
  be as the superuser for HDFS. For more details of related sections, 
  please see [Proxy user - Superusers Acting On Behalf Of Other Users](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Superusers.html)
