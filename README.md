# Apache Uniffle (Incubating)

Uniffle is a high performance, general purpose remote shuffle service for distributed computing engines.
It provides the ability to push shuffle data into centralized storage service,
changing the shuffle style from "local file pull-like style" to "remote block push-like style".
It brings in several advantages like supporting disaggregated storage deployment,
super large shuffle jobs, and high elasticity.
Currently it supports [Apache Spark][1], [Apache Hadoop MapReduce][2] and [Apache Tez][3].

## Architecture
![Rss Architecture](docs/asset/rss_architecture.png)
Uniffle cluster consists of three components, a coordinator cluster, a shuffle server cluster and an optional remote storage (e.g., HDFS).

Coordinator will collect the status of shuffle servers and assign jobs based on some strategy.

Shuffle server will receive the shuffle data, merge them and write to storage.

Depending on different situations, Uniffle supports Memory & Local, Memory & Remote Storage(e.g., HDFS), Memory & Local & Remote Storage(recommendation for production environment).

## Shuffle Process with Uniffle

* Spark driver ask coordinator to get shuffle server for shuffle process
* Spark task write shuffle data to shuffle server with following step:
![Rss Shuffle_Write](docs/asset/rss_shuffle_write.png)
   1. Send KV data to buffer
   2. Flush buffer to queue when buffer is full or buffer manager is full
   3. Thread pool get data from queue
   4. Request memory from shuffle server first and send the shuffle data
   5. Shuffle server cache data in memory first and flush to queue when buffer manager is full
   6. Thread pool get data from queue
   7. Write data to storage with index file and data file
   8. After write data, task report all blockId to shuffle server, this step is used for data validation later
   9. Store taskAttemptId in MapStatus to support Spark speculation

* Depending on different storage types, the spark task will read shuffle data from shuffle server or remote storage or both of them.

## Shuffle file format
The shuffle data is stored with index file and data file. Data file has all blocks for a specific partition and the index file has metadata for every block.

![Rss Shuffle_Write](docs/asset/rss_data_format.png)

## Supported Spark Version
Currently supports Spark 2.3.x, Spark 2.4.x, Spark 3.0.x, Spark 3.1.x, Spark 3.2.x, Spark 3.3.x

Note: To support dynamic allocation, the patch(which is included in patch/spark folder) should be applied to Spark

## Supported MapReduce Version
Currently supports the MapReduce framework of Hadoop 2.8.5, Hadoop 3.2.1

## Building Uniffle
> note: currently Uniffle requires JDK 1.8 to build, adding later JDK support is on our roadmap.

Uniffle is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

     # there will be no data written to DFS if set it as 100g even rss.storage.type=MEMORY_LOCALFILE_HDFS
     # please set a proper value if DFS is used, e.g., 64m, 128m.
     rss.server.flush.cold.storage.threshold.size 100g
   ```
4. start Shuffle Server
   ```
    bash RSS_HOME/bin/start-shuffle-server.sh
   ```

### Deploy Spark Client
1. Add client jar to Spark classpath, e.g., SPARK_HOME/jars/

   The jar for Spark2 is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/spark2/rss-client-XXXXX-shaded.jar

   The jar for Spark3 is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/spark3/rss-client-XXXXX-shaded.jar

2. Update Spark conf to enable Uniffle, e.g.,

   ```
   # Uniffle transmits serialized shuffle data over network, therefore a serializer that supports relocation of
   # serialized object should be used. 
   spark.serialier org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer # this could also be in the spark-defaults.conf
   spark.shuffle.manager org.apache.spark.shuffle.RssShuffleManager
   spark.rss.coordinator.quorum <coordinatorIp1>:19999,<coordinatorIp2>:19999
   # Note: For Spark2, spark.sql.adaptive.enabled should be false because Spark2 doesn't support AQE.
   ```

### Support Spark dynamic allocation

To support spark dynamic allocation with Uniffle, spark code should be updated.
There are 3 patches for spark (2.4.6/3.1.2/3.2.1) in patch/spark folder for reference.

After apply the patch and rebuild spark, add following configuration in spark conf to enable dynamic allocation:
  ```
  spark.shuffle.service.enabled false
  spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled true
  ```

### Deploy MapReduce Client

1. Add client jar to the classpath of each NodeManager, e.g., <HADOOP>/share/hadoop/mapreduce/

The jar for MapReduce is located in <RSS_HOME>/jars/client/mr/rss-client-mr-XXXXX-shaded.jar

2. Update MapReduce conf to enable Uniffle, e.g.,

   ```
   -Dmapreduce.rss.coordinator.quorum=<coordinatorIp1>:19999,<coordinatorIp2>:19999
   -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.RssMRAppMaster
   -Dmapreduce.job.map.output.collector.class=org.apache.hadoop.mapred.RssMapOutputCollector
   -Dmapreduce.job.reduce.shuffle.consumer.plugin.class=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.task.reduce.RssShuffle
   ```
Note that the RssMRAppMaster will automatically disable slow start (i.e., `mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps=1`)
and job recovery (i.e., `yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.recovery.enable=false`)

### Deploy Tez Client

1. Append client jar to pacakge which is set by 'tez.lib.uris'.

In production mode, you can append client jar (rss-client-tez-XXXXX-shaded.jar) to package which is set by 'tez.lib.uris'. 

In development mode, you can append client jar (rss-client-tez-XXXXX-shaded.jar) to HADOOP_CLASSPATH.

2. Update tez-site.xml to enable Uniffle.

| Property Name              |Default| Description                  |
|----------------------------|---|------------------------------|
| tez.am.launch.cmd-opts     |-XX:+PrintGCDetails -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseParallelGC org.apache.tez.dag.app.RssDAGAppMaster| enable remote shuffle service |
| tez.rss.coordinator.quorum |coordinatorIp1:19999,coordinatorIp2:19999|coordinator address|

Note that the RssDAGAppMaster will automatically disable slow start (i.e., `tez.shuffle-vertex-manager.min-src-fraction=1`, `tez.shuffle-vertex-manager.max-src-fraction=1`).

### Deploy In Kubernetes

We have provided an operator for deploying uniffle in kubernetes environments.

For details, see the following document:

[operator docs](docs/operator)

## Configuration

The important configuration is listed as follows.

|Role|Link|
|---|---|
|coordinator|[Uniffle Coordinator Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/coordinator_guide.md)|
|shuffle server|[Uniffle Shuffle Server Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/server_guide.md)|
|client|[Uniffle Shuffle Client Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/blob/master/docs/client_guide.md)|

## Security: Hadoop kerberos authentication
The primary goals of the Uniffle Kerberos security are:
1. to enable secure data access for coordinator/shuffle-servers, like dynamic conf/exclude-node files stored in secured dfs cluster
2. to write shuffle data to kerberos secured dfs cluster for shuffle-servers.

The following security configurations are introduced.

|Property Name|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable|false|Whether enable access secured hadoop cluster|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.krb5-conf.file|-|The file path of krb5.conf. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.keytab.file|-|The kerberos keytab file path. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.principal|-|The kerberos keytab principal. And only when rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.enable is enabled, the option will be valid|
|rss.security.hadoop.kerberos.relogin.interval.sec|60|The kerberos authentication relogin interval. unit: sec|

* The proxy user mechanism is used to keep the data isolation in uniffle, which means the shuffle-data written by 
  shuffle-servers is owned by spark app's user. To achieve the this, the login user specified by above config should 
  be as the superuser for HDFS. For more details of related sections, 
  please see [Proxy user - Superusers Acting On Behalf Of Other Users](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Superusers.html)
