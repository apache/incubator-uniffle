      description: How do you think the documentation can be improved?
      placeholder: >
        Please explain how you think the documentation could be improved. Ideally specify where a new or missing
        documentation should be added and what kind of information should be included. Sometimes people
        writing the documentation do not realise that some assumptions they have might not be in the heads
        of the reader, so try to explain exactly what you would like to see in the docs and why.
