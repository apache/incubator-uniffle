# Uniffle Operator

The __[Uniffle Operator](https://github.com/apache/incubator-uniffle/tree/master/deploy/kubernetes/operator/)__ manages
Apache Uniffle Cluster within Kubernetes.

The operator is currently in beta (`v1alpha1`), and while we do not anticipate changing the API in
backwards-incompatible ways there is no such guarantee yet.

## Documentation

Please visit the following pages for documentation on using and developing the Uniffle Operator:

- [Installation](install.md): step-by-step instructions on how to get uniffle operator running on our cluster
- [Design & Usage](design.md): overview design of operator and detail usage of CRD

### Examples

Example uses of each CRD have been [provided](examples.md).
